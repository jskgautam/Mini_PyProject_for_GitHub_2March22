    "1. Algorithms initial guess is the middle number of the range (lower and upper bound). Then the computer ask the user if the guessed number is high or low or correct with respect to chosen number by user. After every guess the computer will eliminate the search either lower half or upper half of total range. Based on the users reply the computer will guess another number and continue asking for users comment.\n",
    "2. As the number of iteration is not known to reach to the correct number so we will use while loop (not the for loop)"
